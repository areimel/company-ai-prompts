We're thrilled to announce a powerful new feature on our AI Prompt Directory: **Template Prompts**! This new functionality is designed to make your prompt customization process faster, more efficient, and incredibly user-friendly.

## What are Template Prompts?

Have you ever found a great prompt but needed to tweak several parts of it for different scenarios? Manually finding and replacing each variable can be time-consuming and error-prone. That's where Template Prompts come in!

Our system now automatically detects "variables" within prompts. Any word or string starting with the "@" symbol (e.g., `@ProductName`, `@TargetAudience`, `@KeyFeature`) is identified as a fill-in-the-blanks style variable.

## How Does It Work?

When you view a prompt that contains these "@" variables, a new "Template Variables" menu will automatically appear. This interactive menu provides a simple and intuitive way to customize the prompt:

1.  **Automatic Detection:** The system scans the prompt for any text starting with "@".
2.  **Variable Inputs:** For each unique "@" variable found (like `@UserRole` or `@ProjectName`), an input field is displayed in the "Template Variables" section. The label for each input field will clearly show the variable it corresponds to (e.g., "Label: @UserRole").
3.  **Live Updates:** As you type your desired values into these input fields, the prompt text updates *instantly* across all instances of that variable. You'll see your changes reflected in real-time directly in the prompt display area.
4.  **Copy Your Customized Prompt:** Once you're happy with your modifications, simply use the copy button as usual. You'll get the fully customized version of the prompt, ready to use!

This "Mad-Libs" style approach means you can quickly generate multiple variations of a prompt without the hassle of manual find-and-replace.

## Why Use Prompt Templates?

*   **Efficiency:** Save significant time by quickly tailoring prompts to specific needs.
*   **Accuracy:** Reduce the risk of errors that can occur with manual find-and-replace.
*   **Ease of Use:** The intuitive interface makes prompt customization accessible to everyone.
*   **Consistency:** Easily maintain a consistent structure while adapting prompts for various contexts.
*   **Productivity:** Streamline your workflow, especially when working with complex or frequently used prompts that require slight modifications.

For example, if a prompt contains `@ProductType` multiple times, you only need to enter the product type once in the template menu, and all instances will update automatically.
