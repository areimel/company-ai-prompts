      {
        "id": "faq-1",
        "question": "Do I need to be a developer to use this?",
        "answer": "While some technical knowledge helps, the project includes detailed setup instructions. If you can follow a recipe, you can likely get this running. For major customizations, you might want to work with a developer."

      {
        "id": "faq-2",
        "question": "What AI services does it work with?",
        "answer": "Currently configured for Google Gemini, but the Vercel AI SDK supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and many others. Switching providers typically requires changing just a few lines of code."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-3",
        "question": "How much does it cost to run?",
        "answer": "The hosting can be free (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). You'll only pay for AI API calls based on your usage. Google Gemini has generous free tiers to get you started."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-4",
        "question": "Can I remove the branding and make it my own?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can customize everything - colors, logos, text, layout. Make it completely your own brand. The open-source license gives you full freedom to modify and rebrand."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-5",
        "question": "What's the difference between open source and free software?",
        "answer": "Open source means you can see and modify the code. 'Free' usually means no cost, but you might not get the code. This project is both - free to use AND you get all the source code to modify as needed."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-6",
        "question": "Can I use this for my business?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can use this for personal projects, client work, or your own business. The only restriction is that you can't resell the original code itself - but you can absolutely build commercial services with it."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-7",
        "question": "Is there ongoing support?",
        "answer": "This is a community project. While we can't provide individual support, you can report bugs and request features on GitHub where the community can help."
      },
      {
        "id": "faq-8",
        "question": "Can I contribute improvements back?",
        "answer": "Yes! Open source thrives on community contributions. If you add features or fix bugs, you're welcome to submit them back to help others."
